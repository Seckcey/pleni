# Privacy statement

**Last updated: September 30, 2026**

This statement describes how information is handled when you use the Plenipo desktop
application, visit its website, or contact 8 West Ventures, LLC ("8 West", "we", "us").
It covers the product as it operates today. Features and stored information can vary
with the installed version and the connections you enable.

## Who handles your information

Plenipo's app records are kept on your computer. You or your organization control
the projects, permissions, connected accounts, and information used there. 8 West
does not receive those local records simply because you install or run Plenipo.

8 West handles information needed to deliver its website and information you choose
to send us for support or other requests. AI providers, GitHub, Cloudflare, and services
you connect handle information under their own policies. When you use Plenipo for
an employer or another organization, that organization may also set rules for your data.

## Information stored by the desktop app

Depending on how you use the app, local information can include:

- Organization, department, project, and role settings; model choices; permissions;
  and approval decisions.
- Tasks, prompts, worker responses, tool requests, program output, and an activity
  history with times and project references.
- File paths, working copies, browser activity, screenshots, and server or connection
  settings for features you enable.
- Connection details and locally stored account tokens or secrets that you choose
  to save, together with app logs, diagnostics files, and database backups.

The app uses a local SQLite database and files in your account's app-data area.
Project files and working copies can be kept in other folders you choose. On Windows,
Plenipo uses Windows Credential Manager for stored secrets. Installed provider tools
and Plenipo's separate browser profile may keep their own sign-in data and files.

Local records can contain personal or confidential information. Protect your computer,
account, backups, and exported files. An administrator or another program with access
to your account may be able to read them. Secret filtering reduces accidental exposure
but cannot recognize every sensitive value.

## Information sent to AI providers and other services

When you start an AI worker, the installed AI tool sends prompts and task context to
its provider. Depending on the tools and permissions you allow, this can include file
contents, conversation history, command output, messages, and screenshots. Ollama's
supported integration uses cloud models; local app storage does not make those
requests offline.

If you connect another service, use a browser, or authorize work on a server, requests
and information go to the services you choose. An approved program can make its own
network requests. Read the provider's terms, privacy policy, data retention settings,
and rules about using content to train models before sending sensitive information.
8 West does not control those providers' retention or training practices.

Plenipo also makes network requests for features such as update and AI-tool version
checks. App update checks request public release information from GitHub and do not
include your prompts or project contents. The receiving service still sees ordinary
request information, such as your IP address and request headers.

## Website visits, cookies, and analytics

The Plenipo website serves public product information and a fictional interactive
sample. The sample does not run real AI or connect to your desktop app, provider
accounts, projects, or private files. Its choices are held in memory and reset when
the page is reloaded. The website's own code does not use cookies or browser storage
to save those choices, and it has no account, payment, or contact form.

Serving the website involves processing ordinary connection and request information,
which can include an IP address, the requested page, time, referring page, browser
information, and response status. The origin server writes access logs. We use this
information to deliver the site, maintain it, and investigate failures or misuse.

The public site uses Cloudflare for delivery and protection. Cloudflare may add its
Web Analytics beacon, which reports visit and page-performance measurements. Cloudflare
describes Web Analytics as cookie-free; its delivery and security services may
separately process network information or use cookies for security features. The
website source does not add advertising trackers. See
[Cloudflare's privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) and
[Web Analytics information](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) for its practices.

Following a download, GitHub, company, or provider link takes you to another service.
That service handles your visit under its own privacy policy. Website links to GitHub
releases do not make GitHub's download logs part of your local Plenipo records.

## Support, diagnostics, and public GitHub activity

If you email us or submit a report, we receive the information you include: for example,
your address, message, app version, screenshots, or diagnostic files. We use it to
answer you, investigate the issue, maintain the product, and keep a record of the
request. Do not send credentials or more personal information than the request needs.

Diagnostics are created locally when you choose to make them. They are designed to
contain app and system details, event types and times, and filtered app logs, rather
than your activity database, task text, worker answers, or terminal input. Creating
a diagnostic file does not send it to 8 West. Inspect it before choosing to share it.

GitHub issues, discussions, pull requests, and attachments may be public. Public posts
can be copied, indexed, or retained by others even after you remove them. Use
[admin@8westventures.com](mailto:admin@8westventures.com) for private privacy requests.
Do not put sensitive details in a public post. GitHub's own
[privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)
also applies to activity on GitHub.

## Plenipo Pro's weekly license check

A copy of Plenipo with no license key (Free) never contacts 8 West. A copy with a Pro
license key checks with 8 West about once a week, to learn whether its subscription is
still paid. That check sends exactly two things: the key's ID and the version of Plenipo.
It never sends your projects, files, folder names, tasks, workers' answers, or anything
from your records. If you buy Pro, your account, payments, and emails are covered by the
account [privacy notice](https://account.getplenipo.com/privacy).

## Sharing and the reasons for handling information

The desktop app does not automatically upload your local task history to 8 West for
advertising or analytics. Its website code has no advertising profiles or data-broker
integration. Information you authorize an AI tool or connected service to receive is
handled by that service; it is not a promise that no information leaves your computer.

Website delivery and support may involve service providers that process information
for those purposes. We may also disclose information we hold when required by law,
to respond to valid legal requests, or to protect people, rights, and the security
of the service. We do not ask you to give us your provider passwords to get support.

Where data protection law requires a legal basis, handling website and support
information depends on the purpose: delivering a service you request, our legitimate
interests in operating and securing it, complying with law, or consent where required.
Your chosen providers and organization are responsible for their own processing.

## Retention and deleting information

Local history, project files, provider sessions, and exports are not erased merely
by closing Plenipo. The app rotates its own logs and limits the local backups or
diagnostic files it keeps, but those limits do not delete copies you made elsewhere.
Use the app's available deletion controls and your operating system to remove data
you no longer need. Keep needed backups before deleting anything.

On Windows, the uninstaller offers an option to delete Plenipo's app data and stored
secrets. Files in project folders, separate browser or provider profiles, copied
backups, exports, and information already sent to a provider may require separate
removal. Sign out or revoke access at a provider when you no longer want a connection.
8 West cannot remotely erase files on your computer or records held by another service.

We keep information received for website operation or support for the purposes
described above and any applicable legal obligations. Retention depends on the type
of record and the reason it is needed; this statement does not promise a fixed
retention period for every record. Contact us about the information we hold and
whether it can be deleted. Providers' and GitHub's retention policies are separate.

## Your choices and privacy rights

Choose the services and permissions you allow. Avoid sending sensitive information
unless you have the right to do so and have reviewed the receiving service's practices.
You can stop workers, revoke permissions or connections, remove local files, and
choose not to share diagnostics or public reports.

Depending on the law that applies to you, you may have rights to request access,
correction, deletion, restriction, objection, or a copy of personal information
that 8 West holds. You may also be able to withdraw consent for processing based
on consent and complain to a data protection authority. These rights have conditions
and exceptions under applicable law.

Email [admin@8westventures.com](mailto:admin@8westventures.com) with your request.
Include enough information for us to understand it, but do not send passwords or
identity documents unless a secure, necessary verification step is arranged. We may
need to verify your identity before disclosing or changing personal information.
For local data, your organization's data, or provider-held records, contact the party
that controls them.

## International services and children

Internet and AI services may process information outside your country. Their policies
describe where they operate and any safeguards they apply. Consider those policies
before connecting an account or sending information with location restrictions.

Plenipo is intended for people managing work and AI tools, not as a service directed
to children. If you believe a child has sent personal information directly to 8 West,
contact us so we can investigate and address the request.

## Changes and contact

We will update this statement when practices change and show a new date above.
We will provide any additional notice or consent process required by applicable law.
Check the policy and installed version's release notes when you update the app.
